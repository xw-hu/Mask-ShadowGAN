## Prerequisites
* Python 3.5
* PyTorch 1.0
* torchvision
* numpy

  
## Train
1. Select the training sets (USR, SRD, or ISTD ) and set the path of the dataset in ```train_Mask-ShadowGAN.py```
2. Run ```train_Mask-ShadowGAN.py```


## Test   
1. Select the testing sets (USR, SRD, or ISTD ) and set the path of the dataset in ```test.py```
2. Run ```test.py```


## Acknowledgments
Code is implemented based on a [clean and readable Pytorch implementation of CycleGAN](https://github.com/aitorzip/PyTorch-CycleGAN). We would like to thank Aitor Ruano and the authors of [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593), Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros.
